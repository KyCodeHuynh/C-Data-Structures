/* A map designed to hold associations between 
 * key/value pairs, where the keys are C-strings, 
 * and the values are pointers to anything. 
 *
 * Pairs are not maintained in any particular order, 
 * but are accessible in constant time via a 
 * hash table implementation.  
 *
 * This module is designed for compatibility with 
 * ANSI C. The prefix used is "MAP"
